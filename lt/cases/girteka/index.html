8000 trucks in it&rsquo;s fleet. In 2020 they started digital transformation and were
onboarding a vendor for load planning optimization.</p><p>We were tasked with accurate measurement of the impact. We delivered a suite of
KPIs that were aligned with all of the stakeholders, as well as implementation of
neccessary computations, a dashboard for visualization, and a detailed documentation.</p><p>The main challenge was accurate and cofident assesment of the impact, when the KPIs
themselves had a tendency to fluctuate. To this end we designed a Bayesian structural
time series model which separated the impact of the optimization solution from those of
calendar events and business seasons. We also flexibly adapted to their IT
infrastructure and delivered a fully working data engineering pipeline.</p><p>As a result, Girteka could be confident in their purchase and could accurately gouge
the impact of their transformation, for example in this public statement:
&ldquo;as we partnered with Nexogen to utilize their Artificial Intelligence (AI) Planner,
we managed to reduce the number of empty kilometers that our trucks drive by
as much as 10%&rdquo;.</p></body></html>
