FlexBlow is an SME specializing in PET bottle manufacturing and equipment. Their
flagship product is a stretch blow molding machine that can be flexibly reconfigured
to different bottles. A newly planned feature of this machine is an autonomous bottle
quality control.


Our initial task was to program the control algorithm, that automatically adjusts
operational parameters based on the control sensor output. Unfortunatelly, the control
sensor was inadequate for the task, so we took a lead on designing and sourcing the
parts for the new sensor as well. The project is now a joint effort between FlexBlow
(hardware), Elskaifa (electronics) and ThreeThrids (data, algorithms and management).

Together with Elskaifa we designed a low cost sensor that is able to perform close
to 1 million accurate measurements per second. We are now gathering data from the
PoC sensor and developing the real-time closed loop control system, which is expected
to go to production in mid 2022.
