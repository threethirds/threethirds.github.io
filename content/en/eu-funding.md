Three Thirds is participating is several projects, co-financed by the **European Regional Development Fund**:

## Safety Analysis and Argumentation Products R&D for Autonomous Transportation Systems

This project, led by [Sensmetry](https://sensmetry.com), aims to develop prototypes of safety analysis and argumentation tools for autonomous transportation systems, based on a novel modular probabilistic safety analysis methodology. These tools will help autonomous transportation companies meet the upcoming international safety standardization requirements.

Three Thirds is helping Sensmetry to build a simulation environment for testing different traffic scenarios and sensor parameters. Based on such simulations, a rigorous statistical safety argument can be formulated.

*Implementation period: 2020-11-03 - 2022-11-02*


## Promotion and development of innovation networking (InoLink)

This project, implemented by [Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology Agency (MITA)](https://mita.lrv.lt/en/), aims to stimulate integration of enterprises into clusters, to increase maturity of clusters, and to promote growth and international cooperation.

Three Thirds is hoping to increase visibility of its expertise and services among the partners of this project. As a part of this effort, we became the partners of [Life Science Digital Innovation Hub Cluster](https://northtownvilnius.lt/en/cluster/).

## Integration of Lithuanian business into international value chains of Experimental Development and Innovation (InterInoLT)

This project, implemented by [Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology Agency (MITA)](https://mita.lrv.lt/en/), aims to create a network of Lithuanian Experimental Development and Innovation Representatives ("Ambassadors") to promote the potential of Lithuanian Experimental Development and Innovation (R&D&I) abroad by increasing funds from international R&D&I programs, attracting investment to innovative projects, and promoting export of high value-added products and services (innovation).

Three Thirds is hoping to increase visibility of its expertise and services among the partners of this project.
