      <description>Pallet detection and localization system Client&amp;rsquo;s challenge Rubedos is an SME specializing in mobile robotics. In 2021 they started developing an autonomous forklift platform, aiming to autonomously locate a pallet in a loading zone and transfer it to the target location. We joined Rubedos to develop a pallet detection and localization stack that identifies pallets, their orientation and location from a stereo image and LIDAR inputs.
Our solution  Pallet detection system is based on an ensemble of off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks for object detection, adapted to the constraints of Rubedos&amp;rsquo; GPU-powered VIPER stereo camera.</description>

      <description>EndoArt: Aortic aneurysm segmentation and monitoring system Client&amp;rsquo;s challenge Turimeda is an early stage MedTech startup that wants to measure and monitor internal organs without tedious manual labeling effort. Their first product measures abdominal aortic aneurysm – a life-threatening condition when aorta, the main blood vessel, expands and may rupture – based on raw CT scans, and tracks the development of the condition over time.
Our solution  We built a PyTorch-based deep neural network for aortic aneurysm segmentation, trained for multiple days on our custom cloud infrastructure.</description>

      <description>FlexBlow FlexBlow is an SME specializing in PET bottle manufacturing and equipment. Their flagship product is a stretch blow molding machine that can be flexibly reconfigured to different bottles. A newly planned feature of this machine is an autonomous bottle quality control.
Our initial task was to program the control algorithm, that automatically adjusts operational parameters based on the control sensor output. Unfortunatelly, the control sensor was inadequate for the task, so we took a lead on designing and sourcing the parts for the new sensor as well.</description>

      <description>Girteka Girteka is the largest full truck load transport company in Europe, with more than 8000 trucks in it&amp;rsquo;s fleet. In 2020 they started digital transformation and were onboarding a vendor for load planning optimization.
We were tasked with accurate measurement of the impact. We delivered a suite of KPIs that were aligned with all of the stakeholders, as well as implementation of neccessary computations, a dashboard for visualization, and a detailed documentation.</description>

      <description>strato.homes strato.homes is an exciting startup in a modular construction space that builds homes in 3 months from the purchase to the move-in. A part of their vision is an AI planner, that would create a floor-plan based on (1) buyer&amp;rsquo;s choices and (2) engineering restrictions imposed by their modular system.
We took on the challenge and built the PoC AI planner in 7 months. Our deliverable was a floor-plan generation algorithm, a cloud infrastructure setup for high intensity computations, a backend service and a user interface for the exploration of results.</description>
